      Introduction
    </h2><em>This section is non-normative.</em>
    <p>
      This specification aims to make secondary displays such as a projector or
      a connected TV available to the web and takes into account displays that
      are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI or similar) and wireless technologies
      (MiraCast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay or similar).
    </p>
    <p>
      Devices with limited screen size lack the ability to show content to a
      larger audience, for example a group of colleagues in a conference room,
      or friends and family at home. Showing content on an external large
      display helps to improve the perceived quality and impact of the
      presented content.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its core, this specification enables an exchange of messages between a
      requesting page and a presentation page shown in the secondary display.
      How those messages are transmitted is left to the UA in order to allow
      for use of display devices that can be attached in a wide variety of
      ways. For example, when a display device is attached using HDMI or
      MiraCast, the UA on the requesting device can render the requested
      presentation page in that same UA, but instead of displaying in a window
      on that same device, it can use whatever means the operating system
      provides for using those external displays. In that case, both the
      requesting page and the presentation page run on the requesting device
      and the operating system is used to route the presentation display output
      to the other display device. The second display device doesn't need to
      know anything about this spec or that the content involves HTML5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternately, some types of external displays may be able to render HTML5
      themselves and may have defined their own way to send messages to that
      content. In that case, the UA on the requesting device would not need to
      render the presentation page itself. Instead, the UA could act as a proxy
      translating the request to show a page and the messages into the form
      understood by the display device.
    </p>
    <p>
      This way of attaching to displays could be enhanced in the future through
      definition of a standard protocol for delivering these types of messages
      that display devices could choose to implement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The API defined here is intended be used with UAs that attach to display
      devices through any of the above means.

    <h4 id="presentations"><span class="secno">1.1.1 </span>
      Presentations
    </h4>
    <p>
      A user is preparing a set of slides for a talk. Using a web based
      service, she is editing her slides and speaker notes on the primary
      screen, while the secondary larger screen shows a preview of the current
      slide. When the slides are done, her mobile phone allows her to access
      them from an online service while on the go. Coming to the conference,
      using wireless display technology, she would like to present her slides
      on the stage screen from her mobile phone. The phone's touch screen helps
      her to navigate slides and presents a slide preview, while the projector
      shows her slides to the audience.
    </p>

      <a id="video-sharing">Video and Image Sharing</a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Using an online video or image sharing service, a user would like to show
      memorable moments to her friends. Using a device with a small screen, it
      is impossible to show the content to a large group of people. Connecting
      an external TV screen or projector to her device - with a cable or
      wirelessly - the online sharing service now makes use of the connected
      display, allowing a wider audience to enjoy the content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web page shows UI elements that allow the user to trigger displaying
      content on the secondary display (e.g a "send to second screen" ) only if
      there is at least one secondary screen available.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h4 id="gaming"><span class="secno">1.1.3 </span>
      Gaming
    </h4>
    <p>
      Splitting the gaming experience into a near screen controller and a large
      screen visual experience, new gaming experiences can be created.
      Accessing the local display on the small screen device and an external
      larger display allows for richer web-based gaming experiences.

      Media Flinging to Multiple Screens
    </h4>Alice enters a video sharing site using a browser on her tablet. Next,
    Alice picks her favorite video from the site, and the video starts to play
    on her tablet. While the video is playing Alice clicks a button "Share on
    different screen". The browser provides a user interface that lists all the
    screens Alice has around her home, asking her to select one. The screens
    are identified by names that are familiar to Alice. Alice picks one screen
    from the list, "Alice's big TV", and the video playback continues
    seamlessly on the selected screen. Next she decides to switch the playback
    to a different screen. She clicks the same button "Share on different
    screen" provided by the site, and the browser presents the user interface
    that lists all the screens. Alice picks another screen from the list,
    "Alice's kitchen TV", and the playback resumes on that screen. Video site
    also provides a feature to see the action (Alice is watching a soccer game)
    from different angle. Alice clicks a button "Select screen for additional
    angle", and the browser asks Alice similarly to select the screen to be
    used for playback. Alice picks "Alice's Projector" and the soccer game is
    shown on the projector from a different angle, in parallel to the content
    being played back on "Alice's kitchen TV".

          primary and secondary page.
          </li>
          <li>R6: The UA must not make assumptions about the the execution
          locality of the user agent of the remote page it communicates with
          (i.e. the secondary page might run on a remote user agent and thus
          the link between the two pages' UA must be loosely coupled).

          resources in an efficient way. For example, powering up the wireless
          display detection only when needed.

      Example
    </h2>
    <p>
      Running in a compliant user agent, code for presenting a page
      <code>example.html</code> on the presentation display looks as follows:
    </p>
    <pre class="example">/* controller.html */

&lt;button disabled&gt;Show&lt;/button&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var presentation = navigator.presentation,
    showButton = document.querySelector('button');
 
presentation.onavailablechange = function(e) {
  showButton.disabled = !e.available;
  showButton.onclick = show;
};
 
function show() {
  var session = presentation.requestSession('http://example.org/');
 
  session.onstatechange = function() {
    switch (session.state) {
      case 'connected':
        session.postMessage(/*...*/);
        session.onmessage = function() { /*...*/ };
        break;
      case 'disconnected':
        console.log('Disconnected.');
        break;
    }
  };
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
    <p>
      The availability monitoring for secondary screens begins when the page
      adds an event listener for the <code>availablechange</code> event on the
      <code>navigator.presentation</code> object. If there are already
      available screens when the page adds the first event listener for the
      event, the UA synthesizes a single availablechange event to signal the
      availability.
    </p>
    <p class="open-issue">
      Do we want to fire an event immediately after the page registers for it?
      What's a best practice method for asynchronous notifications of ths kind?
      See below in the <a href="#open-questions">Open Questions</a> section.
    </p>
    <p class="open-issue">
      It is an open issue whether to provide filter information as part of the
      request for notification of available screens. This could be useful when
      a particular application or capability is needed in order to display the
      contents of a presentation. One possible approach to this could be to
      provide the URL for the presentation and / or required options as part of
      the request for notification of available screens. If this was supported,
      only screens that satisfied the filter would trigger a notification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Show" button's state (initially disabled) informs the user of the
      availability of secondary screen(s), and the button's state is updated if
      the availability changes. (The rationale of putting the actual boolean
      information into a property of the event <code>e.available</code> is to
      allow the implementation to optimize power consumption for network
      discovery of remote wireless screens. If this information was provided in
      a globally accessible flag, the network discovery could never be
      suspended for keeping the flag up to date.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the user clicks the "Show" button, the <code>show()</code> function
      is called.
    </p>
    <p>
      By calling <code>navigator.presentation.requestSession(url)</code>, the
      script on the page tries to launch or resume a presentation on a
      secondary screen. Based on the <code>url</code> argument, the UA looks
      for existing sessions and available screens, and presents a screen picker
      user interface to the user. Out of the list of existing sessions or
      available screens the user selects one item. If an existing session was
      selected, the session is resumed by establishing a communication channel.
      If a new screen was selected, the UA connects to the selected screen,
      brings up a new window on the selected screen, starts to show the content
      denoted by the <code>url</code> argument, and the UA establishes a
      communication channel with this window.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the <code>navigator.presentation.requestSession(url)</code> function
      is called, the UA immediately returns a <code>session</code> object to
      the script which represents a handle to the current presentation session,
      used for communication and state handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the user has selected a screen, the content is shown and a
      communication channel was established, the state of the session object
      changes from <code>"disconnected"</code> to <code>"connected"</code>,
      which signals the presentation session is up and running, and the opener
      page can communicate with the presentation page. For communication with
      the presentation page, the session object's <code>postMessage()</code> is
      used to send, and the <code>onmessage</code> event handler to receive
      messages.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the user cancels the screen selection and never selects a screen, no
      state transition happens and the <code>session</code> object remains in
      the <code>"disconnected"</code> state.
    </p>

      Open Questions
    </h4>
    <p class="open-issue">
      Do we need to insert into the description an additional permission prompt
      to grant the page access to the "one ore more screens are available"
      Information?
    </p>
    <p class="open-issue">
      If there are already connected screens when the page subscribes to the
      <code>onavailablechange</code> event, we can handle this in two ways: We
      can synthesize one initial event to notify the page about available
      screens as soon as the first event handler is installed (as described).
      Or we can add another message like
      <code>navigator.presentation.getAvailable(function(available) { }
      );</code> to notify the page about available screens using this one-time
      asynchronous getter. Which way should we go?
    </p>
    <p class="open-issue">
      Do we need an additional state like resumed in order to identify resumed
      session? It seems that this could be handled on the page level. The
      opener page could ask the presentation page whether it is
      <code>"new"</code> or <code>"resumed"</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="usage-on-remote-screen"><span class="secno">5.2 </span>
      Usage on Remote Screen
    </h3>
    <p>
      For addressing the requirement of communication between originating page
      and presentation page/screen, the presenting page can now use the same
      <code>session</code> object. It accesses this object through the
      <code>navigator.presentation.session</code> property, which is only
      non-<code>null</code> for the page on the presentation screen.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">if (navigator.presentation.session) {
  var session = navigator.presentation.session;
  // Communicate with opener page.
  session.postMessage(/*...*/);
  session.onmessage = function() {/*...*/};

  session.onstatechange = function() {
    switch (this.state) {
      case "disconnected":
        // Handle disconnection from opener page.
    }
  };
};
</pre>
    <p>
      When the content denoted by the <code>url</code> argument in the
      <code>requestSession()</code> example above is loaded, the page on the
      presentation screen will have its
      <code>navigator.presentation.session</code> property set to the session.
      This session is a similar object as in the first example. Here, its
      initial state is <code>"connected"</code>, which means we can use it to
      communicate with the opener page using <code>postMessage()</code> and
      <code>onmessage</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presentation page can also monitor the connection state by listening
      for <code>statechange</code> events. When the state changes to
      <code>"disconnected"</code> the page is made aware of the fact that
      communication with the opener page was lost, but it can continue to
      display the current content. The communication can be re-established when
      a <code>statechange</code> event fires with a new state of
      <code>"connected"</code>.
