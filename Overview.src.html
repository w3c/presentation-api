        Introduction
      </h2><em>This section is non-normative.</em>
      <p>
        This specification aims to make secondary displays such as a projector
        or a connected TV available to the web and takes into account displays
        that are attached using wired (HDMI, DVI or similar) and wireless
        technologies (MiraCast, Chromecast, DLNA, AirPlay or similar).
      </p>
      <p>
        Devices with limited screen size lack the ability to show content to a
        larger audience, for example, a group of colleagues in a conference
        room, or friends and family at home. Showing content on an external
        large display helps to improve the perceived quality and impact of the
        presented content.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, this specification enables an exchange of messages between
        a requesting page and a presentation page shown in the secondary
        display. How those messages are transmitted is left to the UA in order
        to allow for the use of display devices that can be attached to a wide
        variety of ways. For example, when a display device is attached using
        HDMI or MiraCast, the UA on the requesting device can render the
        requested presentation page in that same UA. Instead of displaying in a
        window on that same device, however, it can use whatever means the
        operating system provides for using those external displays. In that
        case, both the requesting page and the presentation page run on the
        requesting device and the operating system is used to route the
        presentation display output to the other display device. The second
        display device doesn't need to know anything about this spec or that
        the content involves HTML5.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternately, some types of external displays may be able to render
        HTML5 themselves and may have defined their way to send messages to
        that content. In that case, the UA on the requesting device would not
        need to render the presentation page itself. Instead, the UA could act
        as a proxy translating the request to show a page and the messages into
        the form understood by the display device.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way of attaching to displays could be enhanced in the future by
        defining a standard protocol for delivering these types of messages
        that display devices could choose to implement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The API defined here is intended to be used with UAs that attach to
        display devices through any of the above means.

            A user is preparing a set of slides for a talk. Using a web-based
            service, she is editing her slides and speaker notes on the primary
            screen while the secondary larger screen shows a preview of the
            current slide. When the slides are done, her mobile phone allows
            her to access them from an online service while on the go. Coming
            to the conference, using wireless display technology, she would
            like to present her slides on the stage screen from her mobile
            phone. The phone's touch screen helps her to navigate slides and
            presents a slide preview while the projector shows her slides to
            the audience.

            Using an online video or image sharing service, a user would like
            to show memorable moments to her friends. Using a device with a
            small screen, however, a user cannot show the content to a large
            group of people. Connecting an external TV screen or projector to
            her device - with a cable or wirelessly - the online sharing
            service now makes use of the connected display, allowing a wider
            audience to enjoy the content. The web page shows UI elements that
            allow the user to trigger displaying content on the secondary
            display (e.g., a "send to second screen" ) only if there is at
            least one secondary screen available.

            Splitting the gaming experience into a near screen controller and a
            large screen visual experience can create new gaming experiences.
            Accessing the local display on the small screen device and an
            external larger display allows for richer web-based gaming
            experiences.

            Alice enters a video sharing site using a browser on her tablet.
            Next, Alice picks her favorite video from the site, and the video
            starts to play on her tablet. While the video is playing Alice
            clicks a button "Share on different screen". The browser provides a
            user interface that lists all the screens Alice has at her home,
            asking her to select one. The screens are identified by names that
            are familiar to Alice. Alice picks one screen from the list,
            "Alice's big TV", and the video playback continues seamlessly on
            the selected screen. Next she decides to switch the playback to a
            different screen. She clicks the same button "Share on different
            screen" provided by the site, and the browser presents the user
            interface that lists all the screens. Alice picks another screen
            from the list, "Alice's kitchen TV", and the playback resumes on
            that screen. Video site also provides a feature to see the action
            (Alice is watching a soccer game) from a different angle. Alice
            clicks a button "Select screen for additional angle", and the
            browser asks Alice similarly to select the screen for playback.
            Alice picks "Alice's Projector" and the soccer game is shown on the
            projector from a different angle, in parallel to the content being
            played back on "Alice's kitchen TV".

              All API design decisions must be analyzed from a power efficiency
              point of view. Especially when using wireless display
              technologies or querying availability over a radio channel, care
              needs to be taken to design the API in a way that does not pose
              obstacles to using radio resources in an efficient way. For
              example, powering up the wireless display detection only when
              needed.

        The availability monitoring for secondary screens begins when the page
        adds an event listener for the <code>availablechange</code> event on
        the <code>navigator.presentation</code> object. If there are already
        available screens when the page adds the first event listener for the
        event, the UA synthesizes a single <code>availablechange</code> event
        to signal the availability.

        to filter available screens according to the content being
        presented</a>
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>
          Starting new presentations or manually connecting to existing
          presentations
        </h4>
        <p>
          The "Show" button's state (initially disabled) informs the user of
          the availability of secondary screen(s), and the button's state is
          updated if the availability changes. (The rationale of putting the
          actual boolean information into a property of the event
          <code>e.available</code> is to allow the implementation to optimize
          power consumption for network discovery of remote wireless screens.
          If this information was provided in a globally accessible flag, the
          network discovery could never be suspended for keeping the flag up to
          date.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking the "Show" button calls
          <code>navigator.presentation.startSession()</code>, which causes the
          user agent to request from the user a screen to show the
          presentation. The <code>url</code> argument indicates the content to
          be presented. The <code>presentationId</code> argument (optional)
          allows the page to identify this presentation instance, and control
          which other pages may connect to it by setting a hard-to-guess id.
        </p>
        <p class="open-issue">
          As previously discussed on the mailing list - we can add convenience
          here by default-generating an ID.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user selects a screen with an existing presentation showing
          the same <code>url</code> under the same <code>presentationId</code>,
          the <span>opening browsing context</span> is connected to that
          existing presentation. If the user selects a screen without an
          existing presentation, or a screen presenting a different
          <code>url</code> or <code>presentationId</code>, the UA connects to
          the selected screen, brings up a new presentation window on it, and
          starts to show the content denoted by the <code>url</code> argument.
          The UA then connects the <span>opening browsing context</span> to
          this new presentation and allows the <span>opening browsing
          context</span> to exchange messages with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>navigator.presentation.startSession(url, presentationId)</code>
          returns a <code>Promise</code> to the <span>opening browsing
          context</span>. When the user selects a screen, the presentation page
          is shown and a communication channel has been established the
          <code>Promise</code> resolves to a <code>PresentationSession</code>
          object, which acts as a handle to the presentation for communication
          and state handling. Initially, the state of the
          <code>PresentationSession</code> is <code>"connected"</code>. At this
          point, the <span>opening browsing context</span> can communicate with
          the presentation page using the session's <code>postMessage()</code>
          to send messages and its <code>onmessage</code> event handler to
          receive messages. The presentation page will also have access to
          <code>PresentationSession</code> that it can use to send and receive
          messages with the <span>opening browsing context</span> (see <a href=
          "#usage-on-remote-screen">Usage on remote screen</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user cancels screen selection, the <code>Promise</code>
          returned by <code>startSession(url, presentationId)</code> remains
          unresolved.

          While there is a pending call to <code>startSession</code> asking the

          Automatically reconnecting to existing presentations
        </h4>
        <p>
          The <span>opening browsing context</span> may wish to reconnect to an
          existing presentation without prompting the user to select a screen.
          For example, the site could allow media items from different pages to
          be shown on the same presentation page, and does not want to prompt
          the user on each page to reconnect to that presentation. To reconnect
          automatically, the page may call <code>joinSession(url,
          presentationId)</code>, which returns a <code>Promise</code> that
          resolves to an existing <code>PresentationSession</code> if one
          exists that is presenting the same <code>url</code> with the same
          <code>presentationId</code> as was passed originally into
          <code>startSession</code>. The <span>opening browsing context</span>
          can then communicate with the presentation as if the user had
          manually connected to it via <code>startSession</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time the <code>joinSession(url, presentationId)</code> method
          is called, if the browser is not aware of any
          <code>PresentationSession</code> with a matching <code>url</code> and
          <code>presentationId</code>, the <code>Promise</code> should remain
          unresolved. The browser may become aware of such a session at a later
          time (for example, by switching to a WiFi network that has a screen
          showing that URL). In this case, the browser may resolve the Promise
          to allow the page to connect to the running session.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the browser knows of multiple matching sessions, it should connect
          the page to the session that was most recently connected to; if that
          cannot be determined by the browser (for example, if the matching
          sessions have never been connected), then the <code>Promise</code>
          should remain unresolved.

          Usage on remote screen
        </h3>
        <p>
          For addressing the requirement of communication between originating
          page and presentation page/screen, the presenting page can now use
          the same <code>session</code> object. It accesses this object through
          the <code>navigator.presentation.session</code> property, which is
          only non-<code>null</code> for the page on the presentation screen.
        </p>
        <pre class="example">
if (navigator.presentation.session) {
  var session = navigator.presentation.session;
  // Communicate with opening browsing context
  session.postMessage(/*...*/);
  session.onmessage = function() {/*...*/};

  session.onstatechange = function() {
    switch (this.state) {
      case "disconnected":
        // Handle disconnection from opening browsing context
    }
  };
};
</pre>
        <p>
          When the content denoted by the <code>url</code> argument in the
          <code>startSession()</code> example above is loaded, the page on the
          presentation screen will have its
          <code>navigator.presentation.session</code> property set to the
          session. This session is a similar object as in the first example.
          Here, its initial state is <code>"connected"</code>, which means we
          can use it to communicate with the <span>opening browsing
          context</span> using <code>postMessage()</code> and

        <p>
          The presentation page can also monitor the connection state by
          listening for <code>statechange</code> events. When the state changes
          to <code>"disconnected"</code> the page is made aware of the fact
          that communication with the <span>opening browsing context</span> was
          lost, but it can continue to display the current content. The
          communication can be re-established when a <code>statechange</code>
          event fires with a new state of <code>"connected"</code>.

          A <dfn>presentation display</dfn> refers to an external screen

          technology.

        <p>
          A <dfn title="concept-presentation">presentation</dfn> is an active
          connection between a user agent and a <span>presentation
          display</span> for displaying web content on the latter at the
          request of the former.

        <p>
          A <dfn title="concept-presentation-session">presentation
          session</dfn> is an object relating an <span>opening browsing
          context</span> to its <span>presentation display</span> and enabling
          two-way-messaging between them. Each such object has a
          <dfn>presentation session state</dfn> and a <dfn>presentation session
          identifier</dfn> to distinguish it from other <span title=
          "concept-presentation-session">presentation sessions</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          An <dfn>opening browsing context</dfn> is a <span data-anolis-spec=
          "w3c-html">browsing context</span> that has initiated or resumed a
          <span>presentation session</span> by calling
          <code><span>startSession</span>()</code> or

        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>presenting browsing context</dfn> is the browsing context
          responsible for rendering to a <span>presentation display</span>. A
          <span>presenting browsing context</span> can reside in the same user
          agent as the <span>opening browsing context</span> or a different
          one.

          The mechanism used to monitor <a href=

        <p>
          When the user agent is to <dfn>cancel monitoring the list of

        An event named <code>availablechange</code> is fired during the

        availability</span> algorithm when the <dfn>presentation display
        availability</dfn> changes. It is fired at the

        <code>AvailableChangeEvent</code> interface, with the
        <code>available</code> attribute set to the boolean value that the
        algorithm determined.
